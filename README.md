M1 python simulation class final project. A simple PIC plasma solver, done in 3 different dimensions with 3 different points of view by 3 different students.  
  
Attribution and composition is as follows :  
1D - Alexis Robert       - corresponds to the basic level of the assignment given to us  
2D - Cl√©ment Perrochaud  - aims at a nice visualization of the effects in 2D, with a real time pygames illustration  
3D - Matteo Delenda      - a few "fully-EM" cases in 3D       
  
The python files are all in principle (let us know!) plug-and-play, and the simulation tunable with the parameters nicely (we hope!) available at the end.
